Our project aims to cereate a marketplace for Green Credits. We are developing a Green Credit Management System (GCMS), a web-based platform that creates a streamlined marketplace for green credits. GCMS will facilitate the registration, management, and secure trading of green credits, providing businesses with detailed analytics and reports. This solution will enhance transparency, ensure regulatory compliance, and encourage broader participation in sustainable practices, ultimately benefiting both businesses and the environment.
